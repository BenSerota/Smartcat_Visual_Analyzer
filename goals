let's build a real working prototype. 

my goal: take as input any text file T, proccess it, and output a list of terms (present in this file T) which should NOT be altered, in case that this file T is translated to a different language. We call this list a "glossary". 
for example: in the sentence "The company Beacon proffited greatly from the stock's fall", the word "beacon" should not be translated, as it is understandable a name of a company, and should not be taken literally. 
the same is true for : "Natural Intelligence is a great place to work at". 
it is important to note that not all terms will be explicitly capitalized or be company names. we probably need to use an LLM to ensure we are getting the maximal context and understanding about the words we suspect are glossary terms.

to accomplish this, I am thinking the following solution:
1. have a file-upload page.
2. user will be invited to on a button "suggest a glossary based on file".
3. LLM API reads the file, and:
4. based on its world knowledge, builds a short bio including: the probable origin of the file (company/institute), probable role of the writer in that entity (Product manager, marketer, engineer, physician, etc.,), and probable file target audience. It would also be worth thinking of potential terms that are associated with this bio (e.g., if we are realize we are dealing with a marketing campaign written by Coca-Cola, probably terms might include: "Coke Zero", "Coca", etc. )
5. then read/ analyze the text in the file again and finalize the list of words we suspect as potential glossary terms.
